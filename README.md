# Activity Tracker - Full Throttle Labs React JS Assignment

Activity Tracker is a React JS App that renders a list of users along with the activity data. Clicking on a user shows their list of activities on that day. Also, there is a calendar view that shows all their activity data for different days, weeks, and months.

## Example activity data for an user

```
{
  "id":"W012A3CDE",
  "real_name":"Egon Spengler",
  "tz":"America/Los_Angeles",
  "activity_periods":[
    {
      "start_time":"Feb 1 2020  1:33PM",
      "end_time":"Feb 1 2020 1:54PM"
    },
    {
      "start_time":"Mar 1 2020  11:11AM",
      "end_time":"Mar 1 2020 2:00PM"
    },
    {
      "start_time":"Mar 16 2020  5:33PM",
      "end_time":"Mar 16 2020 8:02PM"
    }
  ]
}
```
